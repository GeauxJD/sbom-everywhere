# **OSSF SBOM Everywhere SIG**

- TODO: Add Description

##
**Motivation**

- The initial motivation for the formation of the OSSF SBOM Everywhere SIG is born from OpenSSF's [The Open Source Software Security Mobilization Plan](mobilization_plan.pdf).  SBOM standardization and consensus from within the open source community is integral to adoption of universal constructs that reveal themselves via the exploration of use cases beyond a compliance check box.  [Executive Order ]

##
**Objective**

- The requirements needed to build use cases using SBOMs are clearly
  understood, documented and implemented in current SBOM specifications
- There are “friction free” open source tools that generate SBOMs that meet
  these requirements
- There is readily accessible education, awareness and implementation
  guidance and 3rd party support
